List.c
This is a doubly linked list data structure that includes a "cursor"
for iteration through the list. It is used to store integer data.

List.h
Header file for List ADT

Graph.c
This is a Graph ADT used to store Graphs as well as search through
them using a Depth First Search. I built off of my Graph.c from pa4,
but only used the function list given for pa5.

Graph.h
Header file for Graph ADT

GraphTest.c
This is a way to test the Graph ADT in isolation.

FindComponents.c
This is the main program that does the following:
+Read the input file.
+Assemble a graph object G using newGraph() and addArc()
+Print the adjacency list representation of G to the output file.
+Run DFS on G and G transpose, processing the vertices in the 
second call by decreasing finish times from the first call.
+Determine the strong components of G.
+Print the strong components of G to the output file in 

Makefile
This file creates an executable jar file called FindComponents.
