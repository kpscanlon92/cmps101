List.java
This is a doubly linked list data structure that includes a "cursor"
for iteration through the list. It is used to store objects, which in 
this case are Entries in a Matrix of the form (col, data).

ListTest.java 
This is a way to test the List ADT in isolation.

Matrix.java
A matrix ADT that represents the "sparse" entries using a List ADT to 
contain each row, and the list nodes contain the entries (col, data).

MatrixTest.java
This is a way to test the Matrix ADT in isolation.

Sparse.java
This is the main program that implements Matrix.java and List.java.
It takes in two arguements for the input file and the output file.
It reads through the input file which contains the information for 
two matrices, A and B. It then outputs to the file A, B, (1.5)A, 
A+B, A+A, B-A, A-A, transpose(A), AB, BB.

Makefile
This file creates an executable jar file called Sparse.
