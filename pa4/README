Files:
List.c
This is a doubly linked list data structure that includes a "cursor"
for iteration through the list. It is used to store integer data.

List.h
Header file for List ADT

Graph.c
This is a Graph ADT used to store Graphs as well as search through
them using a Breath First Search.

Graph.h
Header file for Graph ADT

GraphTest.c
This is a way to test the Graph ADT in isolation.

FindPath.c
This is the main class for the program which implements both the 
Graph ADT and the List ADT. It takes in two arguments: input file
and the output file. It reads in the first section of the input file
to build a graph. The next section of the input file is pairs of 
integers in the range 1 to n which specify a pair of vertices in 
the graph. Using the results from the Breath First Search (BFS), it
outputs th distance of the vertices and the shortest path from the 

Makefile
This file creates an executable jar file called FindPath.
